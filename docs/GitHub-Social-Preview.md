# GitHub repo image (social preview)

The banner image is stored in the repo at `.github/social-preview.jpg` and is shown at the top of the README so it appears on the repository front page.

To use it as the **social preview** when the repo link is shared (e.g. on Twitter, Slack):

1. On GitHub, open the repository.
2. Go to **Settings** (repo settings, not account).
3. In the left sidebar, under **General**, scroll to **Social preview**.
4. Click **Edit**, then **Upload an image**.
5. Select `.github/social-preview.jpg` from your clone (or the 1280x640 banner you prefer). GitHub recommends 1280x640 px.

The same image is referenced in the README as `![Banner](.github/social-preview.jpg)` so it always shows on the repo front page.
